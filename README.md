# prbot
My personal ROS robot design for a University project. This project is taught to have SLAM, for that reason the robot must include cameras and lasers. Adittional, there is a little apartment gazebo model.

## Pre requisites:

Ensure to have installed the gazebo ros packages, for kinetic kame flavor the command is as follows:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control
```
> This repository was made on kinetic kame ros distro
